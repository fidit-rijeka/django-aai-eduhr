# Contributing

You are welcome to contribute to the project, whether you're reporting bugs, introducing new features or improving
the documentation. Any help is appreciated!

## Code style and quality

To ensure a consistent, readable, and maintainable codebase, we adhere to strict code style and quality standards. 
This commitment helps us minimize technical debt, simplify code reviews, and enable efficient collaboration among 
contributors.

We primarily leverage `flake8` for comprehensive linting, which helps identify potential errors, enforce stylistic 
conventions, and improve overall code hygiene. Additionally, `isort` is used to automatically sort and format import 
statements, reducing merge conflicts and enhancing code readability. Adhering to these standards is crucial for 
collaborative development, making it easier for everyone to understand, contribute to, and maintain the project. Using 
these tools is **required** for collaboration on this project.

## Additional guidelines

- Check for existing issues or open a new one before starting major changes.
- Write clear, concise commit messages.
- Include tests or documentation updates if applicable.
